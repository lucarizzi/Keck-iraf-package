SIMULATOR News:
--DEC 95: Input/output is now: ID Prior Mag RA DEC [pa min_below min_above].
  There is also an optional "CENTER 9999 equinox RA0 DEC0 [PA_mask]" line
  at the beginning; these values will _override_ any given in the parameters.
  NOTE that colons (rather than spaces) are required in coordinates. 
   Output is to STDOUT or an optional output file.
--Pickoff mirror 2 is shown; aspect ratio is now considered.
--LN2 spillage is now not a problem (ignore warning).
--Boxes are now calibrated according to measurements by Tom Bida.
--The elevation limits should now be accurate for both the service tower and
  the lower shutter, with values kindly provided by Barb Schaefer.
KNOWN BUGS/SHORTCOMINGS:
--The anamorphic factor has NOT been considered, so the "good" mask region is
  _slightly_ wider than shown (of order 15-20% for 600 line grating).
--There's no way to select a guide or alignment object in the program.
--The pickoff mirror _frame_ is not indicated; avoid the region 12mm in X
  to the left of the mirror (toward the mask center).
