      <h3>Background</h3>

      NIRSPEC images taken in low-dispersion spectroscopy mode present
      certain headaches in the data reduction process owing to the
      skewed position of the spectrum relative to detector columns and
      rows.  This document describes a procedure for removing these
      distortions and extracting spectra from NIRSPEC low-dispersion
      images.

      <h3>Procedure (Long Version)</h3>

      <ol>

	<li> <b>Filter cosmic rays.</b>

	  If desired, use a routine such as <a href="http://iraf.noao.edu/scripts/irafhelp?cosmicrays">cosmicrays</a>
	  to remove bad pixels from your set of images.

	  <p>
	<li> <b>Flatten images.</b>

	  If desired, use flatfield images to flatten your data.  But
	  first, think carefully about whether you want to take this
	  step.  If your flatfield image shows numerous streaks along
	  the slit, it's probably due to "junk" on the dewar window as
	  seen through the slit.  Unless your data were taken in
	  stationary tracking mode (unlikely), the pattern of junk may
	  differ on your flats and science images.  Hence, using the
	  flat to correct your science data could do more harm than
	  good to your data.

	  <p>
	<li> <b>Modify image headers.</b>

	  IRAF will eventually need to know which direction is the
	  dispersion direction on these images, so you'd might as well
	  tell it now.  Use this command to add the required
	  header parameter to all of your images:
	  <pre>hedit *.fits dispaxis 2 add+ verify- update+</pre>

	  <p>
	<li> <b>Create trace image.</b>

	  Although the curvature of the spectrum in the <em>x</em>
	  (column) direction is not in itself a problem, it prevents
	  proper removal of the <em>y</em> (row) distortions in the
	  image which complicate sky subtraction.  In order to map and 
	  remove this distortion, you need an appropriate "trace" image.  You
	  can generate one in two ways:

	  <ul>
	    <li> Create an image with strong spectra at several place
	      along the slit, perhaps by co-adding images of your
	      target (if it's bright) or of standard stars (assuming
	      the spectrograph was not moved in between your science
	      images and the calibration star images).

	    <li> If you have a flat image taken with the same
	      instrumental setup as your science images, use the task
	      <a href="mktracer.html">mktracer</a> to generate a trace 
	      image from the flat; e.g. <pre>mktracer 24des0057 trace</pre>
	      
	  </ul>

	  Here are a sample <a href="flat.gif">flat image</a> and <a
	  href="trace.gif">trace image</a> generated with the <a
	  href="mktracer.html">mktracer</a> task.

	  <p>
	<li> <b>Remove x distortion.</b>  In this step, you'll shift
	  all rows of the images to align with the middle row, so that 
	  the spectra will parallel to image columns.

	  <ul>

	    <li> Start up the <a href="xdistcor.html">xdistcor</a>
	    program.  The syntax is:

	      <pre>xdistcor <em>input output ref</em></pre>
	      where:

	      <ul>
		<li> <kbd>input</kbd> is a list of your input
		  science images to be corrected

		<li> <kbd>output</kbd> is a list of the
		  corresponding names to give the corrected images

		<li> <kbd>ref</kbd> is the trace image you created
		  in the previous step

	      </ul>
	      You should include the reference image among your list
	      of input images to be transformed in order to check the 
	      goodness of the correction later.

	    <li> The program will plot a cut across the reference
	      (trace) image.  Mark the two (or more, if you used a
	      stellar trace image) peaks by placing the cursor on them,
	      pressing the <kbd>m</kbd> key, and pressing the
	      <kbd>Enter</kbd> key when prompted for a wavelength of the
	      feature.  The resulting plot should look like <a
		href="identify.gif">this</a>.

	    <li> Press <kbd>f</kbd> to perform a fit to the two
	      points, then <kbd>q</kbd> twice to quit this step.

	    <li> <kbd>xdistcor</kbd> will now try to re-identify the
	      features you marked at other rows along the image.  If
	      you specified <kbd>verbose=yes</kbd> when you ran the
	      program, you will see the results of the fit.  Check
	      that all of your features were found in other rows.

	    <li> Next the program will try to make a fit to the data
	    in order to derive the coordinate transformation required
	    to straighten the image.  The program will prompt whether
	    you want to perform a fit interactively; answer
	    <kbd>yes</kbd>.  It will show a plot of fit residuals;
	    press <kbd>x</kbd> to change the <em>x</em>-axis plotting
	    coordinate, then enter <kbd>y</kbd> to plot residuals
	    versus row number, and press <kbd>f</kbd> again to redo
	    the plot.  The <a href="fitcoords.gif">resulting plot</a>
	    may show some obvious outliers which you can delete
	    manually by placing the cursor on them, pressing
	    <kbd>d</kbd> and then <kbd>p</kbd> to nuke the offending
	    point.  When outliers have been excised, press
	    <kbd>f</kbd> to redo the fit.  Delete additional outliers
	    and re-do the fit as needed.  Press <kbd>q</kbd> to quit
	    the fitting, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> when prompted
	    <pre>Write coordinate map to the database (yes)?</pre>
	    After this, the program will remove the <em>x</em>
	    distortion from all of your images.

	    <li> Check the goodness of the correction by overplotting
	      several cuts along your transformed trace image.  Use
	      the <kbd>implot</kbd> task to do this:
	      <pre>implot <em>outref</em></pre>
	      where <em>outref</em> is the name of your corrected
	      trace image.  You'll get a plot of the middle row of
	      your image.  Zoom in on the region occupied by your
	      features by placing the cursor to the lower left of your 
	      leftmost feature, pressing <kbd>e</kbd> to define an
	      expansion box, then moving to the upper right of your
	      rightmost feature and pressing <kbd>e</kbd> again.  Now
	      overplot a row near the bottom using the following
	      commands:
	      <pre>:o
:l10</pre>
	      Finally, overplot a line near the top:
	      <pre>:o
:l1010</pre>

	      The <a href="implot.gif">resulting plot</a> should show
	      nicely aligned features.  If so, your images are fine
	      and you can proceed to remove <em>y</em> distortions.
	      If not, you'll need to go back and check why things may
	      have failed.

	  </ul>

	  <p>
	<li> <b>Remove y distortion.</b>

	  Next, you need to align the night sky lines with the image
	  rows to ensure adequate night sky line subtraction.  For
	  this you'll use the task <a href="ydistcor.html">ydistcor</a>.

	  <ul>
	    <li>  Run <a href="ydistcor.html">ydistcor</a>.
	      The syntax is:
	      
	      <pre>ydistcor <em>input output ref</em></pre>
	      
	      where:
	      <ul>
		<li> <em>input</em> is the list of <em>x</em>-corrected images from
		  the previous step
		<li> <em>output</em> is the list of <em>y</em>-corrected
		  images to produce
		<li> <em>ref</em> is an emission-line image to use as a
		  reference for tracing this image.  If the spectra in your 
		  science images are faint, choose one of them; otherwise, 
		  use an arc lamp exposure if available.
	      </ul>
	      
	      The program should complete without any need for user
	      input. 
	      
	    <li> Verify the goodness of the rectification by checking
	      alignment of night sky lines on your science images.
	      First, display a corrected image and locate a range of
	      about 100 rows which have nice emission features.  Then
	      use the <a href="plotcuts.html">plotcuts</a> task to
	      plot a cut from a middle column and one near each end of 
	      the slit:

	      <pre>plotcuts y1=<em>first</em> y2=<em>last</em></pre>

	      where <em>first</em> and <em>last</em> are the starting
	      and ending rows of the region to plot.  If the magic
	      works, the <a href="plotcuts.gif">resulting plot</a>
	      should show that the night sky lines are perfectly
	      aligned.

	  </ul>

	  <p>
	<li> <b>Extract Spectra.</b>

	  With the image now carefully rectified, you can proceed to
	  extract spectra.  Use the <a
	  href="http://iraf.noao.edu/scripts/irafhelp?apall">
	  noao.twodspec.apextract.apall</a> task to perform the
	  extractions.  Refer to Section 3.3.2 of the <a
	  href="file://iraf.noao.edu/iraf/docs/spect.ps.Z">User's
	  Guide to Reducing Slit Spectra with IRAF</a>.

	 <li> <em>Inspection.</em>

	      For each spectrum in your image, note whether the target
	      is easily visible near the middle row (512).  For the
	      ones that aren't, try to determine a column number where
	      they appear prominent, due either to a lack of night sky
	      emission lines, or the presence of an emission line in
	      the object.  Note this column number for use in the next
	      step.
	      

	 <li> <em>Define apertures.</em>

	      Run <a
	      href="http://iraf.noao.edu/scripts/irafhelp?apall">apall</a>,
	      answer <kbd>yes</kbd> to the query <kbd>Find
	      apertures?</kbd>, and <kbd>yes</kbd> to the question
	      <kbd>Edit apertures?</kbd>.  The program will plot a cut
	      across the spectrum and mark the suggested aperture.  If
	      desired, remove it by pressing <kbd>d</kbd> and use the
	      <kbd>m</kbd> key to mark the center positions of your target(s).

	      <p>
	      A bracket should appear above the location of each
	      object.  The width of the bracket indicates the region
	      that will be extracted to define your spectrum.
	      Obviously, you want this to obtain as much of the light
	      from the target as possible without including too much
	      of the night sky background light.  Use the <kbd>u</kbd>
	      and <kbd>l</kbd> keys to adjust the upper and lower
	      limits of the aperture to an appropriate size for your
	      object.  If in doubt, be a little generous with the size
	      - the ``optimal extraction'' algorithm employed by
	      <kbd>apall</kbd> will weight each pixel appropriately
	      based on the amount of light.

	      <p>
	      If an object is not visible, use the command <kbd>:line
	      N</kbd> to move to the column where the spectrum was
	      determined to be the most visible, then use <kbd>m</kbd>
	      to mark that spectrum and adjust the size as needed.
	      

	 <li> <em>Define background.</em>

	      For each aperture you've defined, review the
	      corresponding background aperture to verify that it is
	      positioned appropriately for good sky estimation.
	      Select an aperture by moving the cursor to it and
	      pressing the period key.  Use the <kbd>b</kbd> key to
	      enter the background editor.  If the background must be
	      changed, use the <kbd>d</kbd> key to delete the existing
	      sample regions.  Then, define one background region on
	      either side of your spectrum using the <kbd>s</kbd> key
	      to indicate the starting and ending points with the
	      cursor.  Or, explicitly type in the range of rows to be
	      used with the command <kbd>:samp -15:-10 10:15</kbd>,
	      for example.  If your object is so close to the edge of
	      the slit that you can't get a good sky region on one
	      side, then use only the other side to define your sky.
	      Press <kbd>f</kbd> to fit the background data, and
	      <kbd>q</kbd> to quit the background editor.  Repeat this
	      step for each object. 

	 <li><em>Trace spectrum.</em>

	      After defining the object and background apertures for
	      each object, you have told IRAF where to find the object
	      at one particular place on the chip.  Now use <a
	      href="http://iraf.noao.edu/scripts/irafhelp?apall">apall</a>
	      to track the spectrum across all of the columns in the
	      ``trace'' step.  Answer ``yes'' to the queries
	      <kbd>Trace spectra?</kbd>, <kbd>Fit traced spectra
	      interactively?</kbd>, and <kbd>Trace spectrum 1
	      interactively?</kbd>.  If your object is bright, this
	      step will be a piece of cake and IRAF will show you a
	      plot of the trace versus column number, which will be
	      well fit by a line (i.e., second-order Chebyshev
	      polynomial in IRAF-land).  If IRAF reports that it lost
	      the trace, try increasing the <kbd>nsum</kbd> parameter
	      (e.g., <kbd>:nsum 50</kbd>).  The resulting fit should
	      be essentially constant and have an RMS of under 0.2
	      pixels.  Delete outlying points as needed with the
	      <kbd>d</kbd> key.  When a suitable fit is achieved, type
	      <kbd>q</kbd> to quit and proceed to the next spectrum.

	    <li><em>Extract spectrum.</em>
	      
	      Once your spectra have been traced, then
	      go ahead and extract them - have a look at your masterwork!
	      
	  </ol>
	  
	  <p>
	<li> <b>Estimate S/N.</b> So just how good are your spectra?
	  This is relatively easy to determine.  Measure the signal-to-noise
	  (<var>S/N</var>) ratio per pixel in one of two ways:
	  
	  <ol>
	    
	    <li> Run the <a
		href="http://iraf.noao.edu/scripts/irafhelp?splot">splot</a>
	      program to review your spectra stick to band 1).  Select
	      three representative regions of the spectrum, each about 100
	      pixels wide.  Use the <kbd>m</kbd> key to measure
	      <var>S/N</var> within each region.  Note that <a
		href="http://iraf.noao.edu/scripts/irafhelp?splot">splot</a>
	      knows nothing bout the gain and readnoise of the detector - it
	      simply assumes that the bumps and wiggles in the spectrum
	      represent the noise, and compares the size of the ``noise''
	      to the level of signal in the continuum.
	      
	    <li> Compute <var>S/N</var> manually.  By running <a
	    href="http://iraf.noao.edu/scripts/irafhelp?splot">splot</a>
	    in multispec mode, you've saved some useful information.
	    For each aperture, there are 4 bands in the final
	    spectrum.  Band 1 is the extracted spectrum (signal).
	    Band 3 is the square root of the pixel variance or, in
	    other words, the noise.  So to compute <var>S/N</var> at
	    each pixel, just divide the signal spectrum by the noise
	    spectrum:
	      
	      <pre>imarith myspec[*,N,1] / myspec[*,N,4] snr</pre>
	      
	      where <var>N</var> is the aperture number.  If you
	      inspect this spectrum with <a
		href="http://iraf.noao.edu/scripts/irafhelp?splot">
		splot</a> or <a
		href="http://iraf.noao.edu/scripts/irafhelp?implot">implot</a>,
	      you'll see that the values vary widely due to the
	      generally small size of the signal and the wildly varying
	      intensity of the background.  Determine the typical
	      <var>S/N</var> per pixel by using <pre>imstat snr

		href="spec_s2n.html">spec_s2n</a> task will do this for
	      you!
	      
	  </ol>

	  <p>
	<li> <b>Combine spectra.</b> Unless you moved the cross
	disperser in the middle of your image set, your images are
	likely to be very well aligned in wavelength.  In this case,
	you can combine them before doing the wavelength solution.
	  <ul>

	    <li> Check alignment by using the <a
	    href="http://iraf.noao.edu/scripts/irafhelp?splot">splot</a>
	    task to plot your first spectrum, and press <kbd>#</kbd>
	    and enter <kbd>3</kbd> to plot the sky band.  Zoom in on
	    an emission line (use <kbd>w</kbd> to enter window mode
	    and press <kbd>e</kbd> at two locations to define a zoom
	    window), press <kbd>o</kbd> to overplot, press
	    <kbd>g</kbd> to get a new image, enter the name of the
	    image to overplot and enter <kbd>3</kbd> for the band
	    number.  If the <a href="splot.gif">resulting plot</a>
	    shows no wavelength shift, continue combining spectra.  If
	    a shift is apparent, you'll need to independently obtain
	    wavelength solutions for each spectrum and then combine
	    them afterwards.

	    <li> To combine the spectra, use the <a
	    href="http://iraf.noao.edu/scripts/irafhelp?scombine">onedspec.scombine</a> task.  Here are the parameters:

<pre>        input = "*ms.fits"      List of input spectra
       output = "set1_avsigclip" List of output spectra
     (noutput = "")             List of output number combined spectra
     (logfile = "STDOUT")       Log file\n
   (apertures = "")             Apertures to combine
       (group = "apertures")    Grouping option
     (combine = "average")      Type of combine operation
      (reject = "avsigclip")    Type of rejection\n
       (first = no)             Use first spectrum for dispersion?
          (w1 = INDEF)          Starting wavelength of output spectra
          (w2 = INDEF)          Ending wavelength of output spectra
          (dw = INDEF)          Wavelength increment of output spectra
          (nw = INDEF)          Length of output spectra
         (log = no)             Logarithmic increments?\n
       (scale = "median")       Image scaling
        (zero = "none")         Image zero point offset
      (weight = "median")       Image weights
      (sample = "")             Wavelength sample regions for statistics\n
  (lthreshold = INDEF)          Lower threshold
  (hthreshold = INDEF)          Upper threshold
        (nlow = 1)              minmax: Number of low pixels to reject
       (nhigh = 1)              minmax: Number of high pixels to reject
       (nkeep = 1)              Minimum to keep (pos) or maximum to reject (neg
       (mclip = yes)            Use median in sigma clipping algorithms?
      (lsigma = 3.)             Lower sigma clipping factor
      (hsigma = 3.)             Upper sigma clipping factor
     (rdnoise = "25")           ccdclip: CCD readout noise (electrons)
        (gain = "5")            ccdclip: CCD gain (electrons/DN)
      (snoise = "0.")           ccdclip: Sensitivity noise (fraction)
    (sigscale = 0.1)            Tolerance for sigma clipping scaling correction
       (pclip = -0.5)           pclip: Percentile clipping parameter
        (grow = 0)              Radius (pixels) for 1D neighbor rejection
       (blank = 0.)             Value if there are no pixels</pre>

	      These parameters will give you a resultant image in
	      which discrepant pixels have been rejected.  Note that
	      the <kbd>avsigclip</kbd> rejection algorithm used here
	      relies on knowledge of the detector gain and readnoise,
	      so be cure to set the corresponding task parameters
	      <kbd>gain</kbd> and <kbd>rdnoise</kbd> appropriately.

	<li> <b>Derive wavelength solution.</b> Next, you need to map
	  pixels onto wavelengths.  Review Section 3.4.1 of the <a
	    href="file://iraf.noao.edu/iraf/docs/spect.ps.Z">User's Guide
	    to Reducing Slit Spectra with IRAF</a> in preparation for this
	  step.  Customarily, one obtains a solution for the wavelengths
	  based on exposures of a source of emission lines, as provided
	  in many cases by a Neon/Argon arc lamp.  If you wish to do so,
	  linelists for the <a href="neon.dat">neon</a> and <a
	    href="argon.dat">argon</a> lamps are included with this
	  package.  However, your science spectra are likely to be
	  dominated by emission lines from the night sky, thus providing
	  you with a built-in wavelength calibration.  Follow these
	  steps to calibrate your spectrum using the night sky emission
	  lines:
	  
	  <ul>

	    <li> Create an separate sky spectrum by extracting the sky
	      information band from one of your science
	      images:

	      <pre>imcopy <em>myspec</em>[*,1,3] sky</pre>

	      where <em>myspec</em> is the name of your image.

	    <li> Generate a plot of the sky lines by using the <a
		href="http://iraf.noao.edu/scripts/irafhelp?splot">splot</a> task:
	      <pre>splot sky</pre>

	      Print out a paper copy by moving the cursor into the
	      plot and hitting the <kbd>=</kbd> key.

	    <li> Generate a simulated sky plot for the same wavelength
	    range as your spectra with the <a
	    href="skyplot.html">skyplot</a> task.  Here are the
	    parameters:

<pre>      inlines = "<a href="lowd_ir_ohlines.dat">nirspec$lowd_ir_ohlines.dat</a>" File listing sky lines
     outlines = "oh_lines"      Output line list [optional]
     outimage = "oh_image"      Name of image to create [optional]
  (wavelength = 15904.)         Central wavelength [Angstroms]
  (dispersion = 2.901)          Dispersion [Angstroms/px]
        (fwhm = 5.)             Width of sky lines [px]
       (ncols = 1024)           number of pixels in spectrum
    (identify = yes)            Identify lines?
      (nlines = 30)             Number of lines to identify
    (graphics = "stdgraph")     Graphics outimage device</pre>

	      Edit the parameters for the task using the <em>epar</em>
	      command and change the values of the parameters
	      <em>wavelength</em>, <em>dispersion</em>, and
	      <em>fwhm</em> as appropriate for your data.  Run the
	      task and inspect the resulting plot to verify that
	      covers the same wavelength regime as your sky spectrum.
	      Change parameters and re-run if necessary until all of
	      the lines in your sky spectrum are represented in the
	      simulated spectrum.  The task creates a list of the
	      <em>nlines</em> strongest OH emission features and
	      stores it in the file <em>outlines</em>.  Create a
	      hardcopy of the plot using the <kbd>=</kbd> key.

	    <li> Edit the parameters for the <a href="http://iraf.noao.edu/scripts/irafhelp?identify">onedspec.identify</a> 
	      task.  Here are the task parameters:

      (cursor = "")             Graphics cursor input
     (aidpars = "")             Automatic identification algorithm parameters</pre>

	      Set the parameter <em>coordlist</em> to the name of the
	      file you generated with <a
		href="skyplot.html">skyplot</a>.  Set
	      <em>maxfeatures</em> to at least the number of features
	      listed in that file.  Set the threshold to a reasonable
	      minimum value for bright features based on an inspection 
	      of your science spectrum (this helps avoid
	      misidentification of lines. 
	      
	    <li> Run the <a
	    href="http://iraf.noao.edu/scripts/irafhelp?identify">onedspec.identify</a>
	    task to locate the sky lines in your spectrum.  Move your
	      cursor onto the plot, position it over a prominent sky
	      lines, and press the <kbd>m</kbd> key to mark the line.
	      Verify that it found the right feature by checking for a 
	      vertical mark over the intended line.  If okay, enter
	      the wavelength as written on your hardcopy of the
	      simulated sky spectrum.  Identify two more prominent
	      features in the spectrum, one near the right end and one 
	      near the left.  Then press the <kbd>f</kbd> key to fit a 
	      solution.  Press <kbd>q</kbd> to return to the spectrum, 
	      and press <kbd>l</kbd> to automatically mark additional
	      lines.  Press <kbd>f</kbd> again to repeat the fit and
	      press <kbd>l</kbd> to view the non-linear component of
	      the fit.  Delete obvious outliers using the <kbd>d</kbd> 
	      key and re-do the fit by pressing <kbd>f</kbd>.  You
	      should end up with a plot like <a href="identify2.gif">this</a>.
	      Then press <kbd>q</kbd> twice to quit the task, and
	      answer <kbd>yes</kbd> to the prompt:
	      <pre>Write feature data to the database?</pre>

	    <li> Assign the sky spectrum to be the wavelength
	      reference for your image by using the  <a
	    href="http://iraf.noao.edu/scripts/irafhelp?hedit">hedit</a> task:

	      <pre>hedit set1_avsigclip refspec1 sky add+ update+</pre>

	    <li> Apply the wavelength solution via the <a
	    href="http://iraf.noao.edu/scripts/irafhelp?dispcor">onedspec.dispcor</a> task.  The parameters are:

<pre>        input = "set1_avsigclip" List of input spectra
       output = "set1_dispcor"  List of output spectra
   (linearize = no)             Linearize (interpolate) spectra?

     (logfile = "")             Log file</pre>

	      The parameters listed will apply the solution without
	      rebinning the spectrum.

	  </ul>

	  <p>
	<li><b>Excise bad regions.</b> When your target is faint
	  relative to the night sky, your data are likely to show the
	  effects of imperfect background subtraction, as in <a
	    href="splot2.gif">this example</a>.  If desired, interpolate
	  over these messy regions to improve the appearance of your
	  spectrum using the <a href="skyinterp.html">skyinterp</a>
	  task:
	  <ul>

	    <li> Use <a
		href="http://iraf.noao.edu/scripts/irafhelp?splot">splot</a>
	      to inspect your sky image.  Inspect the plot to derive an
	      estimated lower flux level for major night sky lines.  Note
	      this number.

	    <li> Run the <a href="skyinterp.html">skyinterp</a> task
	      to interpolate across pixels affected by strong
	      background emission:

<pre>      inimage = "set1_dispcor"  input image(s)
     outimage = "set1_pretty"   output image(s)
     skyimage = "sky"           image containing sky spectrum
      (thresh = 10000.)         sky value above which to excise
     (verbose = no)             print operations?</pre>

	      Set the <em>thresh</em> parameter to the value for onset 
	      of strong night sky emission as determined in the
	      previous step.

	    <li> Inspect the result to determine whether the spectrum
	      has been "cleaned" to your satisfaction, and re-run the

      <h3>Procedure (Short Version)</h3>

      Having gone through the long procedure above, you may wish to
      take a few shortcuts by using the task <a
      href="donspec.html">donspec</a> to do the bookkeeping for you.
      It will perform the following steps to your data:

      <ul>
	<li> Generate trace image from image specified in parameter
	  <em>xref</em>
	<li> Remove <em>x</em> distortions using <a
	    href="xdistcor.html">xdistcor</a> 
	<li> Allow optional checking of <em>x</em> alignment
	<li> Remove <em>y</em> distortions using <a
	    href="ydistcor.html">ydistcor</a> 
	<li> Allow optional checking of <em>y</em> alignment
	<li> Extract spectra interactively using <em>apall</em>
	<li> Measure median S/N using <a
	    href="spec_s2n.html">spec_s2n</a>
	<li> Average spectra together using <em>scombine</em>
	<li> Extract sky band from first image
	<li> Derive wavelength solution using <em>identify</em>
	<li> Apply wavelength solution using <em>dispcor</em>
	<li> Interactively obtain sky flux threshold
	<li> Remove regions affected by bright night sky lines using <a href="skyinterp.html">skyinterp</a>
      </ul>
      
      The script will <em>not</em> do the following:
      
      <ul>
	<li> Cleaning of cosmic rays and bad pixels
	<li> Flatfielding
	<li> Flux calibration
      </ul>

      Because some task parameters are hardwired, this approach is
      useful only for data meeting the following criteria:

      <ul>
	<li> Target is a point source
	<li> Calibration can be done from night sky lines
      </ul>

      Prior to running this script, you should run the <a
      href="skyplot.html">skyplot</a> task to generate your input
      <em>coordlist</em> listing relevant night sky emission features
      over the wavelength range of interest.
