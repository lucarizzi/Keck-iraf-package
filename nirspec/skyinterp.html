    <h2>Name</h2>
    skyinterp -- interpolate over regions where background is strong
    
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <pre>skyinterp inimage outimage skyimage</pre>
    
    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <dl>
      
      <dt> inimage
      <dd> Names of existing images to be cleaned
	
      <dt> outimage
      <dd> Names of cleaned images to produce

      <dt> skyimage
      <dd> Name of reference sky spectrum

      <dt> thresh
      <dd> Threshold sky value.  Pixels in the input images which
	correspond to pixels in the skyimage having sky values above
	the threshold value will be interpolated over.
	
    </dl>
    
    <h3>Description</h3>

    This task can be used to effectively clean extracted spectra of
    regions which are degraded to to imperfect background subtraction
    in the vicinity of strong emission features.  Such regions
    commonly occur when spectra of faint objects are reduced.

    <p>
      First, inspect a plot of the reference sky spectrum.  Determine
      the flux level which defines, in your judgement, a "strong"
      emission line which is likely to cause trouble in subtraction.
      Set the <em>thresh</em> parameter for this task to that value.

    <p>
      For each input image, this task will perform the following
      operations:

    <ul>
      <li> Create a temporary image by passing a 29-point median
	filter across the image to smooth on long scales.

      <li> Create a temporary image whose pixels consist of data from
	the science image (for regions of low sky background), or data 
	from the median-smoothed image (for regions where the sky flux 
	in the reference image exceeds the threshold).

      <li> Pass a 9-point median filter over this image to generate an 
	image smoothed on smaller scales.

      <li> Create the output image, consisting of pixels from the
	input image in areas of low sky background (sky value &lt;
	threshold) and pixels from the smoothed image created in the
	previous step in those regions where the sky exceeds the
	threshold.

    </ul>
    
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    
    <OL>
      <LI> Replace sky-dominated pixels in the image
	<kbd>foo.fits</kbd> based on sky values from the file
	<kbd>sky.fits</kbd>, creating the output image <kbd>clean.fits</kbd>: 

	<pre>    donspec foo.fits clean.fits sky.fits thresh=15000</pre>

	The plot below shows NIRSPEC data before (white) and after
	(red) cleaning via this task.
