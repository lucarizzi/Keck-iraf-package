    <h2>Name</h2>
    mktracer -- create a trace image from NIRSPEC low-dispersion flat
    
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <pre>mktracer input output</pre>
    
    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <dl>
      
      <dt> input
      <dd> Name of input image.  This image should be a flat image taken
	with NIRSPEC in low-dispersion mode.
	
      <dt> output
      <dd> Name of output image.  This image should contain two lines
	available for tracing.
	
    </dl>
    
    <h3>Description</h3>
    
    The <kbd>mktracer</kbd> task will take as input a NIRSPEC
    low-dispersion flat and generate an image which can be used to map and 
    remove the <em>x</em> distortions from accompanying NIRSPEC
    images.  The following manipulations are performed on the input
    image in order to generate the output image:
    <ul>
      <li> an 11&times;11 pixel boxcar filter is passed over the image 
	to eliminate small-scale features such as hot pixels and
	grunge on the slit, while still maintaining the large-scale
	features of the image
      <li> a gradient filter is used to locate places where the flux
	changes along each image row
      <li> the temporary image is renormalized to a maximum value of 1
      <li> the temporary image is squared to make both the up and down 
	slopes of the illuminated region be positive, and also to
	reduce the width of the gradient peaks for easier detection
      <li> an 11&times;1 median filter is passed over the image to
	smooth over insignificant peaks in each row
      <li> the temporary image is convolved with a wide Gaussian
	filter in the <em>x</em> direction in order to merge double
	peaks into single ones
    </ul>

    All operations take place on temporary images in the current
    directory.  The input image is not affected by these operations.
    The output image is suitable as input to the task <a
    href="xdistcor.html">xdistcor</a>.
    
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    
    <OL>

      <LI> Given an image <kbd>24des0057.fits</kbd> which is a NIRSPEC
	low-dispersion flat, produce a trace image called
	<kbd>trace</kbd>:

	<pre>mktracer mktracer 24des0057 trace</pre>

    </OL>
    
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    
    <UL>
      <LI> Several temporary images will be created and deleted in the 
	current working directory.
    </UL>
