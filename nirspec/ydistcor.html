    <h2>Name</h2>
    ydistcor -- align emission features with image rows
    
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <pre>
ydistcor input output ref
    </pre>
    
    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <dl>
      
      <dt> input
      <dd> Names of input 2-D spectra to be corrected
	
      <dt> output
      <dd> Names of output 2-D spectra to be created

      <dt> ref
      <dd> Name of reference image

      <dt> x1
      <dd> First column to extract

      <dt> x2
      <dd> Last column to extract

      <dt> dy=0
      <dd> Change in row (y) value for features as they move from
	column x1 to column x2.  Note that if the features move toward 
	lower row numbers (as generally done with NIRSPEC images), the 
	value for dy should be negative.
	
    </dl>
    
    <h3>Description</h3>

    Given an input image <em>input</em> plus a range of columns
    <em>x1-x2</em>, this task shifts the columns as needed to align
    emission features with the image rows and thus make reasonable sky
    subtraction possible during the spectral extraction phase of data
    reduction.  

    <p>
      For the selected range of columns, the
      <em>longslit.identify</em> task is used non-interactively to
      find <em>any</em> bright emission features in the image.  Next,
      the <em>reidentify</em> task is used to find these same features
      in other columns, co-adding data as needed in order to have not
      more than a certain number of independent fits for a given
      aperture.  The <em>fitcoords</em> task is used to find a
      solution which fits the coordinates with a polynomial which is
      third order in x and second order in y.  Then the
      <em>transform</em> task will straighten the image.
    
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    
    <OL>
      <LI> A set of NIRSPEC images taken with the same instrument
	settings is to be corrected for <em>y</em> distortion.
	Inspection of the first image (<kbd>24des0022.fits</kbd>)
	shows that the illuminated region extends from column 600 to
	column 800.  Inspection also reveals that a prominent emission 
	line the middle of the image begins at row 550 on the left of
	the slit and ends at row 525 on the right of the slit.
	The task is run with the following parameters:

	<pre>ydistcor *.fits *%.fits%y.fits% 24des0022 x1=600 x2=800 dy=-25</pre>
	
	The new images will be given the same name as the
	corresponding input images, with a <kbd>y</kbd> appended to
	the rootname.

    </OL>
    
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    
    <UL>

      <LI> The x distortion must already have been removed from the
      input image.
