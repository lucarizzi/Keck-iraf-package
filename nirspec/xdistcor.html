    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <dl>
      
      <dt> input

      <dt> output
      <dd> List of corresponding names for corrected output images

      <dt> ref
      <dd> Name of the reference image to use for defining the ends of

    <h3>Description</h3>

    This procedure is used to remove the row distortion inherent in
    NIRSPEC low-dispersion 2-D spectra, a correction that is required
    for subsequent alignment of night sky lines via the <a
    href="ydistcor.html">ydistcor</a> task.  Before running this
    program, you should generate an image which can be used to define
    the "trace" of the spectrum.  Here are two ways to do this:
    
    <ul>
      <li> Create an image with strong spectra at several place
	along the slit, perhaps by co-adding images of your
	target (if it's bright) or of standard stars (assuming
	the spectrograph was not moved in between your science
	images and the calibration star images).
	
      <li> If you have a flat image taken with the same
	instrumental setup as your science images, use the task
	<a href="mktracer.html">mktracer</a> to generate a trace 
	image from the flat; e.g. <pre>mktracer 24des0057 trace</pre>
	
    </ul>

    The task will first check whether the database directory already
    contains a transform solution for your trace image (specified as
    parameter <em>ref</em>).  If so, you will be prompted whether to
    use this existing solution to correct the images, or derive a new
    solution.  If no transform solution is found, the program will
    proceed with deriving a new one.

    <p>
      If a solution is to be derived, the program will first invoke
      the <a
      href="http://iraf.noao.edu/scripts/irafhelp?identify">identify</a>
      task and allow the user to mark features to be traced.  Mark the
      two (or more, if you used a stellar trace image) peaks by
      placing the cursor on them, pressing the <kbd>m</kbd> key, and
      pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key when prompted for a wavelength
      of the feature.  The resulting plot should look like <a
      href="identify.gif">this</a>.

    <p> 
      Press <kbd>f</kbd> to perform a fit to the two points, then
    <kbd>q</kbd> twice to quit this step.

    <p>
      <kbd>xdistcor</kbd> will now try to re-identify the
      features you marked at other rows along the image.  If
      you specified <kbd>verbose=yes</kbd> when you ran the
      program, you will see the results of the fit.  Check
      that all of your features were found in other rows.
      

    <p>
      Next, the program will try to make a fit to the data in order to
      derive the coordinate tranformation required to straighten the
      image.  The program will prompt whether you want to perform a
      fit interactively; answer <kbd>yes</kbd>.  It will show a plot
      of fit residuals; press <kbd>x</kbd> to change the
      <em>x</em>-axis plotting coordinate, then enter <kbd>y</kbd> to
      plot residuals versus row number, and press <kbd>f</kbd> again
      to redo the plot.  The <a href="fitcoords.gif">resulting
      plot</a> may show some obvious outliers which you can delete
      manually by placing the cursor on them, pressing <kbd>d</kbd>
      and then <kbd>p</kbd> to nuke the offending point.  When
      outliers have been excised, press <kbd>f</kbd> to redo the fit.
      Delete additional outliers and re-do the fit as needed.  Press
      <kbd>q</kbd> to quit the fitting, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
      when prompted <pre>Write coordinate map to the database
      (yes)?</pre> 

    <p>
      With the transformation now defined, the program will proceed to
      remove the <em>x</em> distortion from all of your images.

    <p>
      If you included the reference image among those to be corrected,
      you should inspect the resulting corrected reference image to
      ensure that the spectra are now well aligned with the image
      columns.

    
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    
    The user has already use the <a href="mktracer.html">mktracer</a> task
    to create a reference image called <kbd>trace.fits</kbd>.  Given a 
    list of the input images (<kbd>in.lst</kbd>) and output images
    (<kbd>out.lst</kbd>), the following command will generate
    corrected images:

    <pre>xdistcor @in.lst @out.lst trace</pre>

    The corrected version of the trace image will be <kbd>ctrace.fits</kbd>.
    
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    
    <UL>

      <LI> User must have write access to the working directory.

      <LI> Numerous temporary files will be generated in the working
      director.  These are removed on successful completion.

    </UL>
