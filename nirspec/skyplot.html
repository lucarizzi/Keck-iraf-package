    <h2>Name</h2>
    skyplot -- create simlulated sky spectrum and corresponding line list
    
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <pre>skyplot inlines outlines outimage</pre>
    
    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <dl>
      
      <dt> inlines = "nirspec$lowd_ir_ohlines.dat"
      <dd> File listing sky emission features (units of
	&Aring;ngstroms) and intensities (in arbitrary units). 
	The default input list is a set of OH sky lines from about 0.8
	to 2.3 &micro;m which is suitable for most low-dispersions spectra
	taken with NIRSPEC.
	
      <dt> outlines
      <dd> Output list of sky emission lines.  If none is specified, no
	list is produced.

      <dt> outimage
      <dd> Name of image in which to create simulated night sky
	spectrum.  If none is specified, no image is produced.
    
      <dt> wavelength = 10000.
      <dd> Central wavelength [Angstroms] for the wavelength interval
	over which to produce the simulated spectrum and line list.

      <dt> dispersion = 2.077
      <dd> Dispersion [Angstroms/px] of the resulting spectrum.  The
	default was appropriate for a test observation, and should be
	changed to suit your data.

      <dt> fwhm = 5.
      <dd> Width of sky lines [px].  This controls the FWHM of the
	emission lines in the simulated spectrum.  For purposes of
	comparing the simulated spectrum to the lines in your data it
	is best to input the FWHM of skylines in your sky spectra.

      <dt> ncols = 1024
      <dd> Number of pixels in spectrum.  Generally this should be the 
	same as the number of pixels in your NIRSPEC data.

      <dt> identify = yes
      <dd> Determine whether or not to label the emission lines in
	the resultant spectrum with their wavelengths.

      <dt> nlines = 50
      <dd> Number of lines to identify.  The <em>nlines</em> strongest 
	emission lines in the spectrum will be labeled.

      <dt> graphics = "stdgraph"
      <dd> Graphics outimage device for plot of night sky emission
	lines. 

    </dl>
    <h3>Description</h3>

    Given a list of sky emission features and their relative
    intensities, this task will generate a spectrum of these lines
    over the specified wavelength interval.  Optionally, the task will
    create an image and generate a list of the strongest lines in the
    spectrum.

    <p>
      The task will generate a simulated sky spectrum, centered on the
      specified central wavelength, based on the input line list
      <em>inlines</em>.  The spectrum has the number of columns
      specified by parameter <em>ncols</em> and the specified
      <em>dispersion</em>.  A plot of the spectrum is sent to the
      graphics device specified by the <em>graphics</em> parameter.
      If the <em>identify</em> parameter is set true, then the
      <em>nlines</em> strongest features in the spectrum will be
      labeled with their wavelengths.

    <p>
      If the <em>outlines</em> parameter is defined, the task will
      create a list of the <em>nlines</em> strongest features in the
      spectrum and save them to a file.  This file can then by used as 
      input to the 
      <a href="http://iraf.noao.edu/scripts/irafhelp?identify">identify</a>
      task to obtain a wavelength solution based on the night sky
      lines.

    <p>
      If the <em>outimage</em> parameter is defined, the task will
      store the simulated sky spectrum in the specified image.

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    
    <OL>

      <LI> Generate a list and a corresponding hardcopy plot of the 50
      strongest OH night sky lines between 1.0 and 1.25 &micro;m,
      putting the linelist into a file <kbd>lines1.coo</kbd>:

	<pre>skyplot nirspec$lowd_ir_ohlines.dat lines1.coo \
wavelength=11250. dispersion=2.44 fwhm=5 ncols=1024 \
ident+ nlines=50 graphics=stdplot</pre>

	Here is the resulting <a href="skyplot.eps">plot</a>.
    </OL>
    
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    
    <UL>
      <LI> The default linelist is a modified version of that
	published by <a
	  href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2000A%26A...354.1134R&db_key=AST&high=3adcfd905702391">Rousselot et al., 2000, A&amp;A, 354, 1134</a>.   This version of the linelist has been modified
	to (a) exclude all lines with intensity less than 10
	and (b) combine all P1/P2 pairs of unresolved lines.
