LRED upgrade notes:

New image format -- must update xbox (lrbox)
TBD: new pointing origins.
TBD: red/blue descriminator
TBD: define various coord. systems for LRIS

INSTRUME LRISBLUE "LRIS    "

Need to define a common set of params that adequately describe mosaics.
For DEIMOS, we assumed 2 amps, 4x2 array. This is obviously incorrect.
Need to find a way to describe and accomodate various arrangements.

Note that it's not good enough to simply locate the pixels. With multi-amp
readout, alignment boxes can fall across amp boundaries and therefore must
be corrected with typical bias/gain determined a prior.

Work out coordinate systems. XIM,YIM corresponds closely to DEIMOS X,Y. As it
turns out, LRIS is 180-deg off from this, ie, can still use X,Y just as in
DEIMOS

TBD: define POs in ICS; ccd_to_ics to translate coords for the rotation (or
is this how it's done already??)

Q. Why is DETSIZE 4102 in y?
Q. Why is PANEID = 0 when PANE0 is not defined? Or is PANEID = 0 a code for PANE?
