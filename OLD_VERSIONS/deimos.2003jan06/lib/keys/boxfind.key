	w	enter new FWHM for star
	I	interrupt task immediately (abort)
	?	print this list

XBOX trouble-shooting:

Most problems have to do with input box coordinates not matching those in the
image closely enough.  Watch the (del-x,del-y) values and add the appopriate
xoff, yoff parameters to the command line.

Currently, the centering radius is set to about 16 pixels in each axis.  If
the afternoon direct images are taken at DEIMOS ROTATVAL near +135/-45,
boxes should be found even in the face of flexure.
