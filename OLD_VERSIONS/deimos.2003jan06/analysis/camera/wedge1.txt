Using on-axis analysis only and dcam, each element was tilted 1.25e-4 radians,
choosen as 1.5 thou / 12 in.

Elem
 1	 0.020 mm
 2	-0.019
 3	 0.001		no wedge
 4	 0.016
 5	 0.000		no wedge
 6	-0.011
 7	 0.010
 8	-0.006

This is somewhat disturbing: Elem 4 has almost as big an effect as Elem 1/2,
and the measured wedge there is worse (2.0 thou vs 1.5).  Crudely, we
can expect: -0.019 + -0.021 + -0.008 = -0.048 mm, or +/- 3.2 px total.
This represents +/- 10 Cohu px in the double-pass.
