Steps:
1. convert RA,dec --> correct for equinox, epoch, parallax, refraction, etc.
  ==> new RA, DEC

2. Convert to x,y using a scaled Mercator projection (or perhaps better,
a tangent projection into standard coordinates)

3. Now, a fundamental question -- do we define by selecting targets _OR_ by
defining slitlets?

Go ahead via object selection -- it's how people think.

3. We can presumably select objects based on non-overlap in the slit direction
(ie mask PA).  This _may_ introduce overlap on the metal, but who cares? as it
shouldn't overlap in the _image_ where it counts.


4. Note in slit cutting, we may wish to change the corners of the ||gram in
order to line up with the dispersion direction.  We may also need to vary
slit width, _BUT_ do not vary within a given slit (worry about mill stage
step size).



The current version of mapmask is to develop the FITSIO routines.
