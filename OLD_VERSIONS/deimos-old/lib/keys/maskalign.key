MASKALIGN Command Summary:
 
	c	change weight of nearest point (use for undelete)
	d	delete nearest point (same as `c' with wt=0)
	f	perform a new fit
	m	change magnification factor of residual vectors
	?	print this list
	q	quit
	I	interrupt task immediately

Normal Operation:
-- if all looks good, "q"
-- remove ("d") or downweight ("c") poor points (to restore a deleted point,
          you must use "c" and give it a non-zero weight).  After changes are
          made, refit ("f").
