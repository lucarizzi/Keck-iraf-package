In order to do the full extraction, we ask for:
1.  Distortion map of camera -- this should ideally be a mapping of spot
	location to chief-ray angle input.  This way any difference between
	center of spot and chief ray can be absorbed.  However, we may instead
	want the chief ray (radial) and a _correction_ for spot location that
	can vary with radius and theta independently.
1a. Spot location vs. chief ray will also allow us to acount for shifts due
	to vignetting.

2.  The initial wavelength solution should be used to identify night-sky
	lines, or sections for cross-correlation, to allow a low-order
	wavelength correction to be applied.
