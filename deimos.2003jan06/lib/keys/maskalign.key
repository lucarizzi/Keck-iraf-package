MASKALIGN Command Summary:
 
	c	change weight of nearest point (use for undelete)
	d	delete nearest point (same as `c' with wt=0)
	f	perform a new fit
	m	change magnification factor of residual vectors
	?	print this list
	q	quit
	I	interrupt task immediately

HAVING PROBLEMS?
(1) If residual vectors are too large for the viewport window, try
reducing the magnification ("m") until the vectors fit in the window.

(2) Make sure the two reference slits are well-defined -- that is,
they neither extend to the edge of the CCD or mask, NOR lie partially
under the bar.  Also, objects/slits with fractions near 0 or 1 can produce
poor positions, and thus are not ideal as reference objects.
