Check on TNULLn -- is it always text?

Isn't "" a legitimate null for text?  Can we fake by making it " "?

We need to incorporate the changes of ftcol_def in the programs.
-- probably also need to specify input type so that NULLs get appropriately
treated.  This means identifying the data type.  Could do by character,
by definition (TY_REAL, etc) or by defining different subroutines
(ftcol_defi, ftcol_defr, etc).

-- what about if NULL isn't present for numerics? (use INDEF? INDEFI? INDEFR?
etc -- this would require separate subroutine calls, so the proper INDEF could
be matched ...)

DEBUG:  look at actual null values in whead ...
