NAME
lwscoadd -- Convert raw 6-dimensional LWS image to 2-D frame
.ih
USAGE
lwscoadd input output
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
List of input images to process.  These must be 6-dimensional raw LWS
images.  Wildcards may be used to select multiple files.  An "@"-file
may also be used.
.le
.ls output
List of output co-added images to create.  This may be either a list
of files (in which case the number of input and output images must
match), a directory name (in which case the output images will have
the same names as the input images), or a blank string (in which case
the output images will replace the input images).
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Flag which determines whether or not to echo the actions being taken.

DESCRIPTION

The \fBlwscoadd\fR task takes as input a raw image produced by the Long
Wavelength Spectrometer (LWS) at the W. M. Keck Observatory (WMKO) and
outputs an image which properly combines the various layers of the
input.  The raw LWS images have the following dimensions:
.ls (1) detector columns
Index of detector column or "x" coordinate, from 1 to 128.
.le
.ls (2) detector rows
Index of detector row or "y" coordinate, from 1 to 128.
.le
.ls (3) chpbeams
Index of chop beam, 1 for on-source and 2 for off-source.
.le
.ls (4) savesets
Index of the save set; i.e., number of disk writes during a nod set.
.le
.ls (5) nodbeams
Index of nod beam, 1 for on-source and 2 for off-source.
.le
.ls (6) nodsets
Index of the nod set; i.e., number of nods during the exposure.

EXAMPLES

1. To convert a single raw LWS image into an output image in the same directory:

.nf
	cl> lwscoadd lws00001.fits coadd00001.fits
.fi

2. To convert a single raw LWS image into an output image of the same
name in a subdirectory named "coadd/":

.nf
	cl> lwscoadd lws00001.fits coadd/
.fi

3. To replace all LWS images in the current directory with their
co-added versions:

.nf
	cl> lwscoadd *.fits
.fi

.ih
TIME REQUIREMENTS
To process a 32MB raw LWS image on a lightly-loaded UltraSPARC 10
requires less than 4 seconds, which is much faster than equivalent IDL 
routines.
.ih
ALGORITHM
The algorithm can be described as follows:

.nf
    for( each line in the input image){
	set default sense to "positive";
	negate the sense if this layer represents the CHOP OFF beam;
	negate the sense if this layer represents the NOD OFF beam;
	add this line into the final array;
    }
