The LRED package will grow with time. Notes are for cleaning up to make a
more general spectragraph package.

LBOX / XBOX:
there are several defines that should go elsewhere.


GMOS (DMOS):
mosaic routines. Old based on DEIMOS code, which was before PANES were properly
worked out. New should be general, based on PANES, DATASEC, and allowing up to
four amps.

SLA says AMPLOC is char, trailing blanks insignificant. However, suggests
simply treating as INT for now, as only UCO is assigning them.

SLA points out that changing read-out speed and binning will change gain/bias.

Need to implement INSTRUME to determine red/blue side. We could for now
simply translate AMPLOC based on INSTRUME to make gmos work.

THERE APPEARS TO BE A BUG -- NCCD MUST BE 8 OR SEG VILOATION OCCURS
DMOS.x has bug -- imaccf() is int, not bool



REFL.X:
ccd/ics conversion looks good except that CCD size is hardcoded!
Also, there are some TEMP hardcodes in ident_ccd!!

TRACE.X:
ccd_geom: hardcoded; needs updating


TBD:
1. sign on rotation should be reversed
2. sense of X is correct; sense of Y is reversed
3. PO coords are extremely rough
4. Not all POs defined
5. POs should be in ICS to start with.
6. DET_TO_ICS needs input chip number for two mosaics. This routine only used
here -- eliminate.

XBOX: plot should really not be centered on rotation axis; rather, min/max
should be determined and plot scaled for that. Or, center of min/max should be
used with CCDX,CCDY centered on that.

ICS(0,0) should be the center of the cameras, or in practice the perceived
center of the Dewar focal plane. (Some CCDs are offset from these locations).
Units are pixels. Correct long-term? Perhaps mm is better.

I believe we want to have a system wherein there is a ccd_geom (i, ccdi, n),
where it varies with mosaic number.
